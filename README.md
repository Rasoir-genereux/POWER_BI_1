 ## Data transformation
  The participants had the choice to answer some questions in their own words. That creates many customize answers <br>
  which can be considered by as unique answers, even if they where similar.For that reason and to facilitate the transformation,<br>
  we replace those answers by "other". The salary column where by slice and contained a text, which we modifidied by extracting the text and<br>
  calculating the average of each slice.

  Here are the [raw data](https://github.com/Rasoir-genereux/Project_2/blob/main/Project_2/Raw_data.xlsx) and the
